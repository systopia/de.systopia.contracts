## Downloading contract files
The membership_contract custom field in membership_general custom group can hold a contract reference.
This contract reference is matched to a file located in:
```sites/default/files/civicrm/custom/contracts/{reference}.tif```

If the file does not exist, it will not be available for download and the contract reference will not be shown as a link.
